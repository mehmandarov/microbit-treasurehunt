# MicroBit Treasure Hunt

Welcome to the treasure hunt game with micro:bit!

This is how we play this game:
1. We have a set of micro:bits set up as senders ðŸ“¡ hidden somewhere
    - These devices are set up by the game organisers before we start.
    - We tell you the number of devices you need to find.
3. You have to build a receiver ðŸ“¶ to look for the devices.
    - Scroll down to the `Receiver ðŸ“¶` section for pointers.

## Setup ðŸ› 
We are using:
* micro:bit ([homepage](https://microbit.org/))
* DFRobot micro:bit Circular RGB Expansion board v2.0 ([docs](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Micro_bit_Circular_RGB_LED_Expansion_Board_SKU__ROB0150))
